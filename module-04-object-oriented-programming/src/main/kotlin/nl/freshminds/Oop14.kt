/**
 * 1. Create a new data class [Pizza] with a few properties like [name], [size], [toppings], and [price].
 *
 * 2. Implement a companion object within the Pizza class that contains several factory methods for
 * creating different types of pizzas.
 *
 * Implement a factory method createCheesePizza() that creates a cheese pizza and returns it.
 * Implement a factory method createPepperoniPizza() that creates a pepperoni pizza and returns it.
 * Implement a factory method createVeggiePizza() that creates a vegetarian pizza and returns it.
 *
 * 3. Test your implementation by creating a few pizzas using each of the factory methods.
 * Verify that the pizzas are created correctly with the appropriate properties.
 *
 * 4. Mark the Pizza constructor as private so all pizza creation goes through the
 * companion object's factory methods.
