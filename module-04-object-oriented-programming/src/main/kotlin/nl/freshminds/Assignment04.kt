 *
 * 1. Create a [Camera] interface with 2 methods: [takePicture] and [autoAdjustWhiteBalance]
 *
 * 2. Create a class [Iphone] which accepts a property [type] (11, 12, 13, etc) in the primary constructor.
 *
 * 3. Make [Iphone] implement [Camera]. For the implementations just print some text to the console. For example:
 * "Took picture with an Iphone 13" or "Auto adjusted white balance on the Iphone 12".
 *
 * 4. Create a class [Dslr] which accepts a property [model] (Canon D600, Nikon D7500, etc)
 *
 * 5. Make [Dslr] implement the [Camera] interface.
 *
 * 6. Define a main function and create a list of cameras by creating different variants of [Iphone] and [Dslr].
 * Loop over each element in this list and call both [takePicture] and [autoAdjustWhiteBalance] for each element.
